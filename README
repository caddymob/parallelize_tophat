This collection of PBS scripts splits up big FASTQ files and submits them
to a PBS queue system to tophat2 align, then merge back together and run
through cufflinks. 

Fastq format needs to be ${SAMPLE_ID}.R1.QC.fq.gz and ${SAMPLE_ID}.R2.QC.fq.gz 

Run it in the directory with your samples. 

!!! User needs to set env stuff in: export_paths-IDs_tophat-cufflinks.sh

bash ~/SCRIPTS/parallelize_tophat/tophat2/startSplitReads_tophat.sh ${SAMPLE_ID} ${NODE_COUNT}

TODO:

#Things are still hard coded to: ~/SCRIPTS/parallelize_tophat/tophat2/

#Need to figure this one out...

Divide and conquer!
